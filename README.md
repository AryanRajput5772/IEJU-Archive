This project, proudly created by Aryan Rajput in 2025, is committed to supporting students of the Institute of Engineering, Jiwaji University. IEJU Archive aims to provide effortless access to vital academic resources — including previous years' question papers — helping students prepare thoroughly and succeed academically.

IEJU ARCHIVE continues to grow by consistently expanding its repository with a broad range of study materials. By bridging the gap between students and essential academic tools, our mission is to foster a thriving environment of learning, growth, and success.
